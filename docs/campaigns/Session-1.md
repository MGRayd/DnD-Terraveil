### Journal
- Traveled a week by caravan from outside of Terravale, arriving in Valethorn around 4 PM on an autumn day.  
- The party observed the bustling frontier city: markets, new buildings, adventurers, and settlers.  
- Entered the **Ash & Anvil Inn**, a large structure built in the remains of an old forge.  
  - Noted the notice board filled with job postings.  
  - The inn was full of mercenaries and adventuring groups, and the smell of stew filled the air.  

- The party reviewed jobs and selected:  
  - **Hunter Protect Farmers** — offered by **Mayla Dren**.  

- Travelled an hour from the hamlet to a ranch where the child was taken.  
  - Found worn dirt, tracks, and blood leading west.  
  - Determined the creatures are much larger than wolves.  

- Set up an ambush:  
  - Used a cow and an illusion of more cattle as bait.  
  - Took positions around the ranch to wait.  

- As night fell, the air grew cold, and mist began creeping across the ground.  
- The session ended as **blue glowing eyes** appeared near the cow in the mist…
