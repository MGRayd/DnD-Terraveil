### Highlights
- **Combat:**
	- Wolves (crystal-altered) and a larger, crystal-backed creature emerge from the mist.  
	- Lavinia is knocked unconscious but later revived by Lautha.  
	- Onyx finishes the fight by ripping off one of the creature’s crystal spines and impaling it through its head.  
	- The creature dissolves into mist, leaving behind a skull covered in glowing runes.
- **Clues & Discoveries:** 
	- Wolves show unnatural alterations (crystal spines, rapid mist-like decomposition under light).  
	- The runes are cult-like, not religious, linked somehow to Terravale but not yet identified.  
	- Mist seems to grow darker during combat, and responds to magic/light.
- **NPC Interaction:**
	- Returned to the hamlet to speak with **Mayla Dren** and show the runed skull.  
	- Mayla was annoyed when Zarangath questioned her about the aura surrounding her.
- **Aftermath:**
	- Rested for the night in the hamlet after the encounter.
