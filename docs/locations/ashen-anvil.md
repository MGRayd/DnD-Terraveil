## Ashen Anvil Inn
- **Description:** The Ash & Anvil Inn is a cornerstone of Valethorn life, built within the bones of an ancient forge. Its smoky scent and warm hearth make it a natural meeting place for adventurers, settlers, and merchants looking for work or companionship. The inn is loud but welcoming, and its notice board is the primary source of jobs and guild contracts.

- **Appearance:** 
	- Exterior: Weathered stone walls blackened from the original forge fires, reinforced with newer timber and glass. Smoke curls lazily from a crooked chimney.  
	- Interior:  
	- Large common room filled with tables and a central firepit.  
	- A massive chain-suspended cauldron simmers over the fire, filling the room with a savoury aroma.  
	- Warm lantern light and chatter of adventurers create a bustling atmosphere.  
	- Notice board prominently displayed near the entrance, covered in job postings.
