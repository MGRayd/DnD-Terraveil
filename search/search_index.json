The disappearance of the mists has allowed entry into lands that were cut off from the rest of the world for over a century prior. In those years, bold settlers, soldiers, and seekers of fortune have pressed into its borders, raising towns upon ruins, charting forests once cloaked in secrecy, and daring the wilds where strange beasts and older magic's stir. Yet for all their efforts, most of Terraveil remains uncharted, and whispers speak of ancient powers, forgotten vaults, and kingdoms lost to both fire and fog. You are among those who would set foot where few dare tread \u2014 whether for glory, gold, knowledge, or reasons of your own. The roads into Terraveil are perilous, but the promise of discovery calls louder still. The mists may be gone, but mystery lingers, and fate waits for those bold enough to carve their story into the bones of this wild land.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/","title":"Campaign","text":""},{"location":"campaigns/#campaign-calendar","title":"Campaign Calendar","text":""},{"location":"campaigns/#campaign-log","title":"Campaign Log","text":"<p>A chronological index of our Terraveil sessions.</p> <ul> <li>31-08-2025 \u2014 Session 0 Discussed campaign dates, characters and lore. \u2192 Read</li> <li>11-09-2025 \u2014 Session 1 Our tale has not yet begun, but the pieces are moving\u2026 \u2192 Read</li> <li> <ul> <li>11-09-2025 \u2014 Session 2   Battle at the edge of the woods!
